Objective
The primary goal of this task was to perform a practical analysis of a suspicious email and document the key characteristics that identify it as a phishing attempt.

Tools Used
A sample phishing email (obtained from a free, educational online resource).

A free online email header analyzer (such as the one from the Google Admin Toolbox or MXToolbox).

A text editor or document processor to write the final report.

Process
The following steps were taken to complete the analysis and fulfill the task requirements:

Sourced a sample phishing email from a reputable online source for educational purposes.

Examined the email's sender information, specifically the "From" address, to check for signs of spoofing or impersonation.

Utilized an online header analyzer to perform a detailed inspection of the email's headers, looking for discrepancies in the email's routing path and authentication results (e.g., SPF and DKIM failures).

Identified and documented a range of phishing indicators present in the email, including urgent or threatening language, mismatched URLs, and spelling or grammatical errors.

Compiled all findings into a comprehensive report, which is included in this repository.

Key Concepts Applied
This task provided a hands-on opportunity to apply and solidify knowledge of the following cybersecurity concepts:

Phishing: Understanding how attackers use fraudulent messages to steal information.

Email Spoofing: Recognizing how attackers forge sender information to deceive recipients.

Email Authentication Protocols (SPF & DKIM): Gaining an understanding of how these protocols work at a technical level to prevent spoofing.

Social Engineering: Identifying the psychological tactics used to manipulate victims into acting impulsively.
